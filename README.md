# diabetes-detection
This repository is connected to a google colab notebook where diabetes detection was performed on an open source diabetes dataset from kaggle. Two supervised ML techniques were utilized, they include logistic regression, binary classification with neural networks and random forest classifier.
The major metric considered was accuracy. The accuracies on the validation dataset for the three utilized techniques were over 90%.
